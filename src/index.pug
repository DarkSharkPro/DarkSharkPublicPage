It’s our way to motivate the employees, reflect the philosophy of our company and working principles. There are no strict rules or schedule, we work for results. That’s why we strive to create home comfort and friendly environment to avoid monotonous work. No open spaces or other traditional office ‘benefits’.
                                p Every employee has an opportunity to concentrate on work in one of our 5-person rooms. The relax zone is a premise with kitchen and X-Box, where we can always have lunch, communicate and share our ideas and experience. In addition, there is an opportunity to stretch on a climbing frame after long work in front of a computer screen or take a shower after a bike ride.
                                p Convenient transport interchange and subway in a walking distance.
